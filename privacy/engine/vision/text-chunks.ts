// privacy/engine/vision/text-chunks.ts
// The offset table, and the chunking that sits on top of it.
//
// PROVENANCE: ported from the approved reference repo PravAl2028/SIH26171,
// extension/src/offscreen/tasks/chunks.ts (author-granted permission,
// Phase 01), adapted to PRIVIS's Box type. Logic unchanged; comments
// preserved from the source because the two decisions documented in the
// header are the whole difficulty of chunked text detection.
//
// This is the whole difficulty of L2. A token classifier works on one flat
// string and returns character offsets into it; what the gate needs is a box
// on the screen. The offset table is the only thing that connects the two,
// and every span the model returns has to travel back through it.
//
// Two decisions worth stating, because both were tempting to get wrong:
//
//   One string, not one per run. Concatenating every text run into a single
//   document and remembering where each run started is more work than
//   classifying runs individually -- and it is the only version that works.
//   An entity spanning two elements ("Asha" in one span, "Menon" in the next)
//   is invisible to a per-run pass, and a per-run pass also strips the
//   sentence context the model needs to tell a person from a place.
//
//   Chunks overlap, and the overlap is de-duplicated by span identity. A name
//   landing on a chunk boundary would otherwise be cut in half and missed by
//   both chunks. With a 50-token overlap it is whole in at least one of them
//   -- and then reported twice, which is why the de-duplication is not
//   optional.
//
// Phase 01 status: seam + tests landed; unwired (the DOM text path uses the
// per-element lexical layer today). Node-pure: no model, no browser, no
// tokenizer. What counts as a "token" is injected, because the real answer is
// the model's tokenizer and this module must not care which.
