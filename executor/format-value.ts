/**
 * The value a field will actually accept, from the value a person said.
 *
 * PROVENANCE: ported verbatim (logic unchanged) from the approved reference
 * repo PravAl2028/SIH26171, extension/src/content/format.ts (author-granted
 * permission, Phase 01). Only this header was added; the module lives at
 * executor/format-value.ts so the content-script executor can bundle it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * "DOB is 24th jan 2000" reached the right field on the real page, typed `24th jan 2000`
 * into it, and the field was empty a moment later. The box is `maxlength="10"`, its
 * placeholder is `DD-MM-YYYY`, its title says "Enter Date of Birth in DD-MM-YYYY Format",
 * and it runs `CheckDobDate()` on change. Nothing was wrong with the perception, the
 * resolution or the plan. The agent simply handed the page a string in a shape the page
 * does not take, and the page threw it away.
 *
 * A person does not do that. They read "DD-MM-YYYY" off the box and type `24-01-2000`. That
 * is not a reasoning problem and it should not cost a model call: the field states its own
 * format, in the placeholder, in the title, in `type="date"`, sometimes in `pattern`. This
 * module reads that statement and reshapes the value to match.
 *
 * ## Deterministic, and deliberately so
 *
 * Every rule here is a function of the field and the string. That matters more than it
 * sounds: a model asked to reformat a date is slower, is not reproducible between runs, and
 * has an opinion about which of 06/07 is the month. A parser has no opinion -- it reads the
 * order off the placeholder, and when the placeholder does not say, it does not guess.
 *
 * ## What it will not do
 *
 * Reformat on a hunch. If the field declares no format, the value is passed through
 * untouched apart from trimming. Inventing a shape for a field that never asked for one is
 * how you turn a value the user typed into a value they did not.
 *
 * Node-pure: takes a description of the field, not the field.
